HAIKU EXAMPLES:

In the moonlight,

The color and scent of the wisteria

Seems far away.

---

Everything I touch

with tenderness, alas,

pricks like a bramble.

---

The crow has flown away:

swaying in the evening sun,

a leafless tree.  

---

Over-ripe sushi,
The Master
Is full of regret.

---

I kill an ant
and realize my three children
have been watching.

---

Space is limited
In a haiku, so it's hard
To finish what you

--

I see you driving
Round town with the girl I love
And I'm like haiku.

---

World is vast and wide.
So much out there to explore.
Right now, let's eat lunch.
